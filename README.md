# Readability Score

My 6th project from Hyperskill.

This program allows user to calculate the readability score of the text in a file (the path is accapted as a console parameter) and outputs the recommended age to understand it. It also counts the number of sentences, words, characters (without spaces), syllables and polysyllables.

Algorithms implemented:
- Flesch–Kincaid readability tests;
- SMOG index;
- Coleman–Liau index;
- Automated readability index.
